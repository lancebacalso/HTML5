		<h1>TIMELINE</h1>
		<section>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Franco started as a collaboration project between Alipe, Toleran, Meneses and Mendoza, who are prominent musicians in the Pinoy rock scene. In late 2008, deciding to have a front man for their project band, Alipe, Mendoza, Toleran and Meneses collaborated with Reyes, who had returned to the Philippines from a stay in the U.S., thus completing the band, Franco.[3] In 2009, they recorded songs that comprised Franco's first album. Upon the release of the first album in 2010, their songs quickly became hits and topped the charts. The band dominated the 2010 NU Rock Awards with 4 awards and 9 nominations. They were also nominated and won an award in the 2010 Awit Awards. However, in 2012, Alipe, Meneses, Toleran and Mendoza left the group,[4] with Franco Reyes persisting to continue. Recruiting former bandmates from Cebu, Franco, now a principal act, released his sophomore studio album in 2013, entitled Soul Adventurer. Franco now tours with new members, namely Paul Cañada, Dave Delfin and Victor Guison.</p>

			<h3>MUSIC</h3>
			<p>Franco's musical roots are traced to a Cebu-based band named Frank!, formed by Reyes in 1996, which is credited for having boosted the Cebu rock scene.[3] However, despite reggae-leaning songs originally composed by Reyes for Frank!, the latter music of Franco became considerably heavier. Interestingly enough, two Franco songs — “Touch the Sky” and “Song for the Suspect — have Rastafarian messages.</p>
